    (open-output-string)   ;; return a new string output port

    A string output port is similar to a file output port, except that
    characters and objects written to the port are placed in a string (which
    grows as needed) rather than to a file. It is not necessary to close a
    string port, although it is okay to do so.

    (get-output-string string-output-port)  ;; return the associated string

    As a side effect, get-output-string resets string-output-port so that
    subsequent output to string-output-string is placed into a fresh string.

    (with-output-to-string zero-arg-func)   ;; return a string

    This function calls the zero-arg-func, and redirect its current output
    port to a new string output port, and then returned the result string.

    ;; port operations

    (block-write port s)
    (block-write port s n)
    (clear-output-port port)
    (close-port port)
    (port-output-index port)  ;; current position index
    (port-output-size port)   ;; port current buffer size
    (port-output-count port)  ;; current available buffer size (size - index)
    (write s [port])
    (write-char c [port])
    (display s [port])
    (newline [port])

    The default port is current-output-port, its initial value is the same
    port as the initial value of console-output-port. Other pre-defined ports
    are including console-error-port, current-error-port.
